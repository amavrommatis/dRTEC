# dRTEC: distributed Event Calculus for Run-Time reasoning

dRTEC is an open-source library that consists of a distributed event recognition engine. This engine uses RTEC, which is an Event Calculus dialect
with novel implementation and 'windowing' techniques that allow for efficient event recognition, scalable to large data streams.
dRTEC is written in [Scala programming language](http://www.scala-lang.org) with [Apache Spark Streaming](http://spark.apache.org/streaming/).
